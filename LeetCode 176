Solution 1: Not a generic Solution 
select max(salary)as SecondHighestSalary  from employee where salary < (select max(salary) from employee)



Solution 2 : Handling Same Salary scenario and null part
select ifnull ((select distinct(salary) from employee order by salary desc  limit 1 offset 1),null) as SecondHighestSalary



Solution 3: 
select ifnull((
select distinct salary  from ( select salary, dense_rank()
over(order by salary desc ) as dn from employee)temp where temp.dn=2),null)
as SecondHighestSalary;
